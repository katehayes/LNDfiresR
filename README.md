# LDNfiresR
<br><br>
**Context:** after a fire in an overcrowded rental property in Shadwell, a local residents' group are preparing to speak to Tower Hamlets council about fire safety in HMOs. They want to look at trends in fire data w.r.t. time, location (borough or ward etc.), dwelling type (HMO vs. single occupancy), HMO license type (licensed vs. unlicensed).
