# LDNfiresR
**Context:** after a fire in an overcrowded, unlicensed HMO in Shadwell, a local residents' group are preparing to speak to Tower Hamlets council about fire safety in rental properties. They want to look at trends in fire data w.r.t. time, location (borough or ward etc.), dwelling type (HMO vs. single occupancy), HMO license type (licensed vs. unlicensed).

Data available in two chunks, 2009-2017 and 2018-onwards<br>

<br>
Fires in licensed HMOs look like they're becoming more frequent over time, while fires in unlicensed HMOs (& HMOs with unknown license status) happen less. Dwelling fires in London are, overall, becoming less frequent and so fires in licensed HMOs are making up a growing proportion of total fires. <br>

Dwelling fires in Tower Hamlets are (unsurprisingly) only a fraction of London's dwelling fires - though the fraction is growing, as fire frequency in the rest of London falls faster than in TH.<br>
